----

command:  start

   -> bot checks that there are at least 5 people playing.  if number
      of players is even, issue a warning, recommend getting an odd
      number.

   -> bot sends /msg to each nick, stating each person's role, and
      reminding player to keep it a secret.

   -> bot creates randomly-named "private" werewolf and seer channels,
      invites the 3 people to join them, and waits until they do.

   -> bot reports that the game has been successfully initialized, and
      is ready to continue.  (game commands won't work until game has
      been correctly started.)

   -> bot explains scenario: 2 people are werewolves, one is a seer,
      everyone else is villager.  wolves are hiding, trying to kill
      everyone.  villagers are trying to lynch werewolves.


Night Cycle runs automatically:

   -> bot prints night-speech to public channel, tells everyone that
      they are asleep, and to please wait.

   -> simultaneously:

        * in private werewolf channel, bot tells wolves to discuss
          whom to kill.  both wolves must type "kill <username>" to
          signify agreement

        * in private seer channel, bot asks seer to ask about
          someone.  seer types "ask <username>", and bot responds with
          "<username> is/isn't a werewolf."

   -> when both private channels are 'complete', then bot prints
      speech into public channel:  "You awake to find the mutilated
      body of <username>.  Upon examining the body, you discover that
      this person was actually a {villager|werewolf|seer}."

        -> bot 'devoices' the dead player!!

Day Cycle runs automatically:

   -> bot prints day-speech to public channel: tells everyone that as
      a mob, they demand bloody justice.  they must lynch somebody.
      they must discuss who it will be, and they can take as long as
      they want to decide.   when each player has decided, they must
      type "lynch <username>".

   -> bot doesn't let lynching happen until a majority (> 50%) of
      players have agreed on same person.  if no player has >50%
      votes, all votes are tossed and voting begins from scratch.

   -> after someone is lynched, bot reveals their true role.  person
      is dead, bot 'devoices' them.


Game ends when:

   user types "quit" command, or

   both wolves are dead, or,

   number of wolves == number of players.
