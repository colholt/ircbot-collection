Things to improve:

- command parser doesn't like trailing whitespace in commands. use strip().

- nickname tracking:

    - when people leave mid-game, notice and update the game accordingly
    - same thing when somebody changes nick.

- create new command show voter breakdown (prints vote hash)

- should wolfbot speak in bold?

- need ability to create a 'list' of players before the game starts,
  some sort of registry that we can add/remove players from.
